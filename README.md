# Passport XYZ

## What is Passport?

Many social organizations, online particularly, have difficulty ensuring that every participant is a unique human and does not have multiple participating accounts. Most existing digital identity solutions are either centralized (e.g., national identity cards) or individualistic (e.g., most “self-sovereign” identity models). However, identity is naturally [intersectional and social](https://www.radicalxchange.org/concepts/intersectional-social-identity/); everybody shares different data and relationships with a unique set of others. Passport aims to provide a more collaborative and secure infrastructure for digital identity by capturing the richness of our diversely shared lives.

Passport is an identity verification application. We have written software enabling people to grow personal collections of [verifiable credentials](https://decentralized-id.com/web-standards/w3c/wg/vc/verifiable-credentials/) about themselves and organizations to assess their identities to coordinate rights and responsibilities. The institutions define, verify, and utilize identity as functions of the networked records of the individuals. While we build the Passport agnostic to specific applications, we are actively exploring its benefits for [personhood proofs](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Proof_of_personhood) and [plurality](https://www.radicalxchange.org/media/blog/why-i-am-a-pluralist/) in organizational designs.

## Contributing

We welcome everyone to contribute to Passport and the Scorer API! Please review our [contributing guidelines](./CONTRIBUTING.md) before proceeding.

You can join our [Discord](https://discord.gg/passport) (just be sure to select the builder role when you join) to get help and discuss the project with the rest of the community.

You can also familiarize yourself with our near term project roadmap in the passport [project backlog](https://github.com/orgs/passportxyz/projects/)

## Reviewing Changes

Once a pull request is sent, the Passport team will review your changes. We outline our process below to clarify the roles of everyone involved.

All pull requests must be approved by two committers before being merged into the repository. If any changes are necessary, the team will leave appropriate comments requesting changes to the code. Unfortunately, we cannot guarantee a pull request will be merged, even when modifications are requested, as the Passport team will re-evaluate the contribution as it changes.

Committers may also push style changes directly to your branch. If you would rather manage all changes yourself, you can disable the "Allow edits from maintainers" feature when submitting your pull request.

The Passport team may optionally assign someone to review a pull request. If someone is assigned, they must explicitly approve the code before another team member can merge it.

When the review finishes, your pull request will be squashed and merged into the repository. If you have carefully organized your commits and believe they should be merged without squashing, please mention it in a comment.

## Quick Start

Prerequisites: [Node (v16 LTS)](https://nodejs.org/en/download/) plus [Yarn](https://classic.yarnpkg.com/en/docs/install/) and [Git](https://git-scm.com/downloads)

1. Install Passport (this will install all packages within the passport monorepo):

```sh
git clone https://github.com/passportxyz/passport.git
cd passport
npm install --global lerna
lerna init
lerna bootstrap
```

2. Create environment files, and replace environment variables with your own values

```sh
cp ./app/.env-example.env ./app/.env
cp ./iam/.env-example.env ./iam/.env
cp ./schemas/.env-example.env ./schemas/.env
```

3. Start iam, app, and ceramic services concurrently:

```sh
# remember to create .env files first
yarn start
```

4. Run the [Passport Scorer API](https://github.com/passportxyz/passport-scorer/tree/main/api) locally. Set up instructions are [here](https://github.com/passportxyz/passport-scorer/blob/main/SETUP.md)

## Passport Data

A passport has two sources of data. The primary source is a postgres database that is hosted by Passport XYZ. To run the passport application locally you will need spin up the [Scorer API](https://github.com/passportxyz/passport-scorer/tree/main/api). All relevant instructions to run the scorer api can be found [here](https://github.com/passportxyz/passport-scorer/blob/main/SETUP.md). The sample environment variables in the .env-example.env files are configured to make requests to the scorer api running locally. Once the scorer api is running locally, you should have a reliable data source for development.

A second source of data is the Ceramic network. No steps are needed to run the ceramic network locally. The sample environment variables in the .env-example.env files are configured to make requests to a test version of the ceramic network.

The third location is in onchain attestations that are made across about a dozen different networks. For more information on the onchain attestations, you can reference details [here](https://easscan.org/).
