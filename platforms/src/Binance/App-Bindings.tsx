        Obtain your Binance Stamp by completing the following steps:
        <br />
        <br />
        <strong>Step 1:</strong> Obtain your{" "}
        <Hyperlink href="https://www.binance.com/en/babt">Binance Account Bound Token (BABT)</Hyperlink> using the same
        address that you&apos;re currently using with this Passport.
        <br />
        <br />
        <strong>Step 2:</strong> Click &quot;Verify&quot; below for the Stamp to check that BABT is owned by this wallet
        address.
        <br />
        <br />
        This will prove you&apos;ve completed the Government ID verification process (KYC) on Binance.
        <br />
        <br />
        Important considerations:
        <ul>
          <li>
            You <em>must</em> attach the Binance Account Bound Token (BABT) to the same address that you are using with
            this Passport.
          </li>
          <li>
            If you attached your BABT to your Binance wallet and aren&apos;t using that wallet with Passport, you will
            not be able to verify this Stamp.
          </li>
        </ul>
