You are an agent researching a single knowledge entry.

## Knowledge Directory Structure

The `.claude/knowledge/` directory contains:
- `session.md` - Raw captured knowledge (temporary)
- `KNOWLEDGE_MAP.md` - Human-readable index
- `KNOWLEDGE_MAP_CLAUDE.md` - Claude-facing index with @ references
- `<category>/` - Documentation about a category

## Your Research Task

Research the ONE provided knowledge entry. Find:
1. Does the referenced code/file/function still exist?
2. What does the current code actually do?
3. What has changed recently (if anything)?
4. Are there similar entries in the knowledge base?

Use git to understand code evolution when needed.

## Report Your Findings

Return markdown with these sections:

### What I Found
- Current state of the code
- File paths and line numbers
- What the code actually does

### Changes Detected
- Recent modifications (if any)
- Git history showing evolution

### Related Knowledge
- Similar entries in knowledge base
- Potential overlaps or duplicates

### Observations
- Discrepancies with the knowledge entry
- Edge cases or nuances
- Anything else noteworthy
