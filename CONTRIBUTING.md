# Contributing

We welcome everyone to contribute to Passports and the Scorer API. But please
review the following guidelines before you begin.

There are a couple of ways you can contribute to the Scorer API:

- Contribute code and help us work through the backlog
- Build on top of Passports (by integrating it into your own product)
- Submit a big as part of our bug bounty program

## Getting Started

Before you take an issue and submit a PR, please take some time to get the
application running locally.

[Read through our setup guide](./SETUP.md).

Additionally, please take some time to familiarize yourself with the
[backlog](https://github.com/orgs/gitcoinco/projects/6) and to introduce
yourself to the team on [Discord](https://discord.gg/w6K2wwHr).

## Reporting issues

Before reporting an issue, please make sure to verify the following:

- You're running the latest version, including other components and systems the project might interact with 
- Your dependencies are up to date
- If the issue still persists, search the issue tracker. If there is an open ticket, please don't comment '+1' or similar - use the 'üëç' emoji. Only comment if you have additional context, reproduction instructions or anything that might help resolve the issue.

When opening a new issue, make sure it contains the following:

- Step-by-step reproduction instructions
- Screenshots or videos of the issue, if applicable
- Version information of the project
- Any other context that you feel would help resolve the issue

## Contributing Code

Before submitting a PR, please make sure that all tests, linting and formatting
rules are passing.

We squash all PRs by default. You can request your PR commits to not be squashed
if the're well named and organized, and it would make sense to preserve their
context.

To keep the repository clean, we may mark PRs as stale if there has been no
activity for more than a week, which are then subject to closure and deletion.
If you are stuck, feel free to reach out for help in Discord.

## Reviewing Changes

Once a pull request is submitted, the Passport team will review your changes. We
outline our process below to clarify the roles of everyone involved.

All pull requests must be approved by two committers before being merged into
the repository. If any changes are necessary, the team will leave appropriate
comments requesting changes to the code. Unfortunately, we cannot guarantee
a pull request will be merged, even when modifications are requested, as the
Passport team will re-evaluate the contribution as it changes.

Committers may also push style changes directly to your branch. If you would
rather manage all changes yourself, you can disable the "Allow edits from
maintainers" feature when submitting your pull request.

The Passport team may optionally assign someone to review a pull request. If
someone is assigned, they must explicitly approve the code before another team
member can merge it.

When the review finishes, your pull request will be squashed and merged into the
repository. If you have carefully organized your commits and believe they should
be merged without squashing, please mention it in a comment.
